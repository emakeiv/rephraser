Rephraser feature
-----------------

The input for rephrase feature is the user's entered text (or text from the user's website) and the output
of the feature is - rephrased text. For example:
 - The first pair of Shleps was knit by Edu's grandma - as a gift for a climbing grandson. Wasn't long
 before people in the climbing gym started noticed and putting ideas into our heads - so here we are !
 transform into :
 - Edu's grandma lovingly knitted the intial set of Shleps as a special present for her adventurous grandson
who enjoyed climbing. It didn't take much time for others at the climbing gym to take notice and inspire us
with their suggestions, leading us to where we are today!

We agreed that rephrasing endpoint will accept such HTTP request:
{
      "text": "Text that user entered in their website text block and that needs to be rephrased"
      "number_of variants": 2
}

Response from yout API endpoint should look like this:
[
      "Rephrased text variant 1",
      "Rephrased text variant 2"
]

Section content generation feature
----------------------------------
The input for this feature consists of user-provided bussiness decsriptions and a section structure 
needed for a website. The output is the provided structure echanced with generated text. It is agreed
that the section content generation endpoint will accept such HTTP request:

{
      "description": "User business decription",
      "sections": [
            "about": {
                  "title": 1,
                  "description": 2
            },
            "refunds": {
                  "title": 1,
                  "description": 1
            },
            "hero": {
                  "title": 1,
                  "subtitle": 1
            }
      ]
}

Where the sections object contains information about what sections are needed for the user's 
website and each section can have title, subtitle, and description (they are all optional) 
fields that describe the section. For example about section can have title and description
field required in one request/case but title , subtitle and description on the next request/case. 
Each section fields are optional. It is agreed that for now only about, refund and hero sections 
will be supported by this API. Keep in mind that some websites might not use all of the sections 
for example about and hero sections are needed. Response from this API endpoint should look like this:
{
      "about":{
            "title": "About us",
            "description": [
                  "We do something",
                  "Developing unique products"
            ]
      },
      "refunds":{
            "title": "Information about refund",
            "description": "I want to know more"
      },
